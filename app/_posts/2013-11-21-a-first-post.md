First, a <a href="#tools-that-made-this-website">link to a H2</a>

A long time ago I stopped updating my portfolio and website at <a href="http://andrel.me">andrel.me</a>, and now I'm feeling the need to write again.

__Writing__ is a great way to consolidate our practising. Sometimes we only read about something new but don't have the opportunity to try it.

<blockquote>
    I was ever a great fan of Jekyll, and lately I became a great fan of Grunt
</blockquote>

There is where we start to write about some we've read to make it solid in mind.

## Another thing to mention
While we write, we have others steps in that process like preparing the content and all that stuff.

<h2 id="tools-that-made-this-website">Tools that made this website</h2>
I was ever a great fan of _Jekyll_, and lately I became a great fan of _Grunt_. This is the stuff I used to made this website possible:

<ul>
    <li>Jekyll</li>
    <li>Grunt</li>
    <li>Bower</li>
</ul>

{% highlight css linenos %}
.class {
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
    }
{% endhighlight %}

This block was just to test <a href="#another-thing-to-mention">Pygments</a>, now I need to test some inline code like <code>gem 'bootstrap'</code>
